REAL-LIFE EXAMPLES — How ERC-20 functions work (simple, realistic)

We’ll use a pretend token called YC_V1.
Assume:
- Alice has 10 YC_V1
- Bob has 0 YC_V1
- A Shop (smart contract/app) sells a digital item for 2 YC_V1

------------------------------------------------------------
1) name() / symbol() / decimals()
------------------------------------------------------------

Real life analogy: the label on the money.

- name()  = “YC Version 1 Token”  (full official name)
- symbol() = “YC_V1”              (short ticker like “USD”)
- decimals() = 18                 (like saying “we count in cents… but way smaller”)

Why it matters:
- Wallets and apps display the token correctly:
  “You have 3.5 YC_V1” instead of a huge integer.

------------------------------------------------------------
2) totalSupply() — “How many exist in total?”
------------------------------------------------------------

Real life analogy: how many gift cards were printed.

Example:
- When you deploy, you mint 10 tokens to yourself.
- totalSupply() returns 10 tokens (internally it’s 10 * 10^18 units)

Used by:
- People checking if the token is scarce or unlimited
- Token dashboards / explorers

------------------------------------------------------------
3) balanceOf(address) — “How many does this person have?”
------------------------------------------------------------

Real life analogy: checking someone’s wallet balance.

Example:
- balanceOf(Alice) = 10
- balanceOf(Bob)   = 0

Used by:
- MetaMask showing your balance
- Apps checking if you can afford something

------------------------------------------------------------
4) transfer(to, value) — “Send tokens directly”
------------------------------------------------------------

Real life analogy: handing cash to your friend.

Example:
Alice sends Bob 3 tokens.

Action:
- Alice calls transfer(Bob, 3)

Result:
- Alice balance: 10 → 7
- Bob balance:   0 → 3
- A Transfer event is logged (like a receipt)

When to use:
- Paying a friend
- Sending tokens to another wallet you own

Important:
- This is “direct send”. No permissions involved.

------------------------------------------------------------
5) approve(spender, value) — “Give spending permission”
------------------------------------------------------------

Real life analogy: giving your friend a permission slip / spending limit.

Imagine the Shop needs to pull tokens from you when you buy something.
But the Shop cannot take tokens unless you allow it.

Example:
Alice wants to buy an item for 2 tokens from Shop.

Step 1 (permission):
- Alice calls approve(Shop, 2)

Meaning:
- “Shop is allowed to spend up to 2 of my tokens.”

Result:
- No tokens moved yet!
- Only permission is recorded.

Why this exists:
- Smart contracts can’t “click MetaMask” for you.
- Approve is how you say “I allow this contract to take X tokens.”

------------------------------------------------------------
6) allowance(owner, spender) — “How much permission is still left?”
------------------------------------------------------------

Real life analogy: checking how much money your permission slip still allows.

Example:
After approve(Shop, 2):
- allowance(Alice, Shop) = 2

After Shop spends 2 tokens:
- allowance(Alice, Shop) = 0

Used by:
- Apps showing “Approved amount”
- You checking if you accidentally approved too much

------------------------------------------------------------
7) transferFrom(from, to, value) — “Spender spends for you (if approved)”
------------------------------------------------------------

Real life analogy: your friend uses the permission slip to pay.

Continuing the Shop example:

Step 2 (payment):
- The Shop calls transferFrom(Alice, Shop, 2)

This is the Shop taking payment from Alice.

Result:
- Alice balance: 7 → 5 (she paid 2)
- Shop balance: increases by 2
- allowance(Alice, Shop): 2 → 0
- Transfer event logged

When to use:
- Buying on a DEX (Uniswap-style swaps)
- Depositing into a staking contract
- Paying a game contract
- Any “contract pulls tokens from you” situation

------------------------------------------------------------
BIG IDEA (why ERC-20 is powerful)
------------------------------------------------------------

There are TWO common ways tokens move:

A) Direct sending (person → person)
   transfer(Bob, 3)
   Like handing cash directly.

B) Permission-based spending (person → contract/app)
   approve(Shop, 2)
   then Shop uses transferFrom(Alice, Shop, 2)
   Like giving a spending limit to an app.

This is why wallets + exchanges can support “almost any token”:
they all speak the same ERC-20 language.

------------------------------------------------------------
Mini story: Uniswap-style swap (super common)
------------------------------------------------------------

Alice wants to swap 5 YC_V1 for another token on a DEX.

1) Alice approves the DEX contract:
   approve(DEX, 5)

2) DEX contract pulls tokens from Alice:
   transferFrom(Alice, DEX, 5)

3) DEX sends Alice the other token (separate transfer in that other token)

This is how most DeFi apps work.
